# Developing VB.NET Reporting Applications

Microsoft provides different programming language for its most popular `.NET` and `.NET Framework` environments. The Visual Basic (VB or VB.NET) is an advanced programming language fully supported by Telerik Reporting.
This article elaborates on developing Telerik Reporting [report definitions]({%slug on-telerik-reporting%}#report-definition) with VB, and integrating Telerik Reporting into VB Desktop and Web Reporting applications.

## Developing VB.NET Report Definitions

The VB Type report definitions are VB Types inheriting the Telerik Reporting base [Report](/api/telerik.reporting.report) type.

The easiest and recommended approach for creating such a report in the .NET Framework is with the [Visual Studio Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/overview%}). The designer offers also a converter from declarative (TRDP and TRDX files) to VB type report definitions as explained in the article [Importing Reports Created with the Standalone or Web Report Designer]({%slug telerikreporting/designing-reports/report-designer-tools/desktop-designers/visual-studio-report-designer/how-to-import-reports-created-with-standalone-report-designer%}).

VB reports are supported also in .NET. The Visual Studio Report Designer is not yet available for .NET and the recommended approach for developing such reports is described in the KB article [How to use Visual Studio Report Designer to edit CS Reports in .NET Projects]({%slug how-to-use-vs-designer-in-dotnet-core%}).

## VB.NET Desktop Reporting Applications

### Displaying Reports in VB Desktop Reporting Applications

The Telerik Reporting product provides the following Report Viewers:

* [Windows Forms Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/overview%})
* [WPF Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/wpf-application/overview%})
* [WinUI Report Viewer]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/winui-3-desktop-application/overview%})

#### Implementation

The Desktop Report Viewers may be embedded in .NET Framework and .NET Visual Basic projects. The steps for the corresponding viewers and environments are described in the following sections:

##### Implementing in VB projects targeting .NET Framework 4.6.2 and above

* [Adding the Windows Forms Report Viewer to a Windows Forms .NET Framework Project]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-windows-forms'-.net-framework-project%})
* [Integrating the WPF Report Viewer in .NET Framework]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/wpf-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-wpf-.net-framework-project%})

##### Implementing in VB projects targeting .NET 6.0 and above

The following Report Viewers may be configured manually in VB desktop projects. There are no Visual Studio Reporting templates available for Visual Basic projects targeting .NET:

* [Adding the Windows Forms Report Viewer Control to a Windows Forms .NET Project]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/windows-forms-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-windows-forms'-.net-core-project%})
* [Integrating the WPF Report Viewer in .NET]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/wpf-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-wpf-.net-core-project%})
* [Integrating the WinUI Report Viewer in .NET 6]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/winui-3-desktop-application/how-to-add-report-viewer-to-a-.net-5-application%})

### Generating Reports in VB Desktop Reporting Applications

The VB Desktop Report Viewers may use an Embedded Reporting Engine, a [Telerik Reporting REST Services]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/host-the-report-engine-remotely/telerik-reporting-rest-services/overview%}), or a [Telerik Report Server](https://docs.telerik.com/report-server/introduction). The [Connection String to Report Engine]({%slug telerikreporting/using-reports-in-applications/display-reports-in-applications/how-to-construct-a-string-to-connect-to-report-engine%}) determines the engine type used by the viewer.

The Embedded Reporting Engine is integrated within the viewer of the VB Reporting project.

The Reporting REST Service provides an Application Programming Interface (API) over HTTP to the Reporting Engine that processes and renders [Telerik Reports]({%slug on-telerik-reporting%}#report-definition). The fully functional implementation of the service is available in the `Telerik.Reporting.Services.WebApi` (for the .NET Framework) and `Telerik.Reporting.Services.AspNetCore` (for .NET) assembly/package. It may be embedded in any VB.NET Web Reporting Application and exposed in a custom controller (for example, `ReportsController`) inheriting the basic `ReportsControllerBase` class. The `ReportsController` may be used as a source of Report documents by VB Web Reporting, VB Desktop Reporting, and other third-party client applications.

The Report Server is a separate application exposing a [Web API](https://docs.telerik.com/report-server/implementer-guide/apis/rest-api/v2/api-reference) that may be used by the viewers in VB.NET Reporting applications to request reports.

## VB.NET Web Reporting Applications in .NET Framework

### Requirements in .NET 6.0+

.NET 6 introduced a [globalization-invariant mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/runtime-config/globalization) which, if enabled, does not allow the creation of any culture except the invariant culture. The Report Engine relies on instantiating cultures to support localization, formatting, and unit conversion, so enabling invariant globalization will break the engine's functionality. Refer to the [Only invariant culture is supported in globalization-invariant mode]({%slug only-invariant-culture-is-supported-in-globalization-invariant-mode-error%}) article for instructions on how to disable the `Invariant Globalization` mode.
