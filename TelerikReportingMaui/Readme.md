In this project, you will see how to display a Telerik Reporting report into a .NET MAUI applications by using the HTML5 Report Viewer.

The HTML5 Report Viewer of this sample uses the Reporting REST Service of the [Telerik Reporting online demos](https://demos.telerik.com/reporting). The online demos version is upgraded with each Telerik Reporting release. This sample loads all Reporting resources from the online demos, hence should not need further upgrades.

You may preview but cannot print or export the reports with this solution.
The reason for the limitations is that the MAUI WebView is not a full-blown browser and printing and downloading do not come out-of-the-box.
For the supported functionality you can check the [WebView description in the MS documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/webview?pivots=devices-android).
